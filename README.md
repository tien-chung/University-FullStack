# University Full Stack

This is a dabase project include both Front end UI and back end services. 

## Front End 
I implemented the front end by using **ReactJS**.

You can find the code for this in the suffolk-frontend folder. 

## Back End 
I implemented the back end by using **Java Spring Boot**

Here is the link to [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&platformVersion=3.0.0&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=11&groupId=com.codewithtien&artifactId=University%20Full%20Stack&name=University%20Full%20Stack&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.codewithtien.University%20Full%20Stack&dependencies=mysql,web,devtools)

You can find the code for the this in the suffolk-backend folder.

## How to run the project

1. First start your database server by using `mysql.server start`

3. Open your favorite editor for Java, I use IntelliJ and run the suffolk-backend. 
4. Open another editor for ReactJS/JavaScript. I use Visual Studio Code. 
5. Open the terminal on VSCode. `cd suffolk-frontend` and write the command `run npm` to start reactJS.
